## When/Where's the next meeting?

Meetings typically take place once a month - usually in the 3rd week of the month. Sign up to our group for automatic notification of the exact dates.

We try and split meet ups between Bristol and Bath, but if you want it closer to home then by all means let us know or volunteer to help organise. 

## What happens?

Evenings start with a short intro from the organisers, then a guest speaker or two, a short comfort break couple more awesome speakers, then we head to a reserved area near by pub and it's over to you for socialising and networking.
